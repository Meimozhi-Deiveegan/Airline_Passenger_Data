# Time Series Analysis Project Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details a project focused on analyzing time series data, specifically the "AirPassengers.csv" dataset, which represents the monthly number of airline passengers. The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and apply time series modeling techniques to understand the underlying patterns and potentially forecast future passenger numbers. We utilize Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives were:

* To load and preprocess the time series data.
* To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics.
* To decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
* To apply ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling for forecasting.

## 3. Methodology

The project followed these steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection:**
    * Imported necessary Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels.
    * Loaded the "AirPassengers.csv" dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    * Displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand the data's structure.
    * Checked the data types and descriptive statistics.

2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Converted the 'Month' column to datetime format.
    * Set the 'Month' column as the DataFrame's index.
    * Removed the original 'Month' column.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visualized the time series data using a line plot to observe trends and seasonality.
    * Performed time series decomposition to separate trend, seasonality, and residuals.

4.  **ARIMA Modeling:**
    * Calculated the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to determine ARIMA model parameters.
    * Applied the ARIMA model to forecast future passenger numbers.

## 4. Dataset Description

The "AirPassengers.csv" dataset contains the following columns:

* **Month:** The month and year of the observation.
* **\#Passengers:** The number of airline passengers for that month.

## 5. Results and Observations

* The time series data exhibits a clear upward trend and seasonal patterns.
* The decomposition revealed a strong seasonal component, indicating regular fluctuations throughout the year.
* The ACF and PACF plots aided in determining the appropriate parameters for the ARIMA model.
* The ARIMA model was applied, and forecasts were generated.

## 6. Conclusion

This project successfully analyzed the AirPassengers time series data, performed EDA, and applied ARIMA modeling for forecasting. The results provide insights into the trends and seasonality of airline passenger numbers, which can be valuable for planning and decision-making.

## 7. Future Work

Future work on this project could include:

* Applying more advanced time series forecasting techniques, such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Prophet.
* Performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize the ARIMA model.
* Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Incorporating external factors (e.g., economic indicators, holidays) to improve forecasting accuracy.
* Using more modern deep learning time series forecasting methods such as LSTMs.
* Performing a more in depth EDA to find any outliers or other anomalies.
